Project Description:
We want to build an interactive website to present data on GDP, Life Expectancy, Net Migration, and Population.  This website will highlight connection among indices such as the more income a nation has, the higher life expectancy will be.  It will have numerous charts using map, time trend analysis, bar chart, regression and etc.

Tools:
•	ChartJS:  for animated charts.  This is a new library that we did not study in class.
•	MySQL:  all data points are related by Country Code.  It makes senses to use relational database.
•	HTML5, CSS, and JS:  for interactive charts.
